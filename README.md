# login-screen
This app is built using Flutter and includes a login screen as one of its pages. The screen utilizes stacks to layer containers on top of each other. Inside these containers, images are used within buttons to enhance the design. The layout is crafted using basic margins, paddings, rows, and columns to create a clean and functional user interface.
